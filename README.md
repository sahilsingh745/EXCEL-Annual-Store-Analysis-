Annual Vrinda Store Analysis
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of the annual performance of the Vrinda store, executed using Microsoft Excel.
The analysis encompasses several critical steps, including data cleaning, processing, and visualization. 
Initially, raw sales data was imported and meticulously cleaned to remove any inaccuracies and inconsistencies, ensuring data integrity. 
Subsequently, the processed data was analyzed to uncover trends and insights, which informed the development of an interactive dashboard. 
This dashboard visually represents key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales growth, product performance, and seasonal trends, 
allowing stakeholders to make data-driven decisions effectively. 
Through this project, we aim to enhance the strategic planning capabilities of the Vrinda store by providing a clear and concise overview of its annual performance.
